 . Once you connect the USB Power cable, the Pi will boot up. You will see startup messages on the connected
   monitor. One of the last messages printed during startup is the Pi IP Address, a few lines before the login prompt:
----
    My IP Address is x.x.x.x

    Raspian GNU/Linux 7 raspberrypi tty1

    raspberryipi login: _
----

  . You can use this IP Address to connect to the Pi via `ssh`. The default userId is `pi`, and password is `raspberry`.

      my-pc$ ssh pi@the-Pi-IP-address

    You can use this IP Address to connect to Nexus running on the pi. The default Nexus administrator credentials
    are user: `admin`, password: `admin123`.
