SD Card Setup
=============

  Install RaspianOS on a SDCard. See: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

  You could also review the python program in [pysdcard](https://github.com/bhamail/pinexus/tree/master/pysdcard) for ways to create 
    bootable SDCard images.
