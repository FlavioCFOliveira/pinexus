Pi Supplies
===========

Here's a quick list of hardware you need to build this puppy. In addition to
the items listed below, you need a network connection (network cable or USB
Wifi adapter) and video display (HDMI cable, HDMI-to-DVI adapter, or Analog
Audo/Video cable). A USB Keyboard and Mouse are optional, as most everything
can be done via `ssh`.

  1. (Optional) $7.00 - Pi 3 Model B case
